    "about_content":"The continuous development and innovative application of new information technology has brought about major changes in peoples’ viewpoints towards digital technology, which in turn has significantly impacted the current and future job market, leading to an urgent demand for people talented in the fields of digital technology and visual design. Talents cross-trained in these fields are not only highly irreplaceable, but will also enjoy more competitive advantages in the future. In view of these benefits and the needs of the market, the National Taipei University of Education is actively cultivating talents in its students by investing resources and pursuing a forward-looking and open approach towards education. The establishment of the Department of Digital Technology Design in August 2006 was the humble beginning of our school’s attempts at promoting these cross-disciplinary talents. At that time, our school began to recruit high school students into this department, combining a solid core of theoretical technology, information, and design classes with solid hands-on and practical lessons, with additional special training available as well. After students gain knowledge and skills in this cross-disciplinary field and graduate from the program, they are awarded the title of “Bachelor of Design”.    ",
